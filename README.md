# 👋 Hey, I'm Lorenzo

**Engineer by degree, developer by passion, and financial tech enthusiast by ambition.**

I’m a Brazilian Software Developer with Italian roots and a mission: to bridge the gap between technology and financial empowerment. I specialize in building robust full-stack solutions with a product mindset — and I do it with clean code, high empathy, and caffeine-powered focus.

## 🚀 What I’m Building

- **💸 Meu Bolso** – A personal finance manager built with Node.js, Next.js, and SQLite. Tracks your bank accounts, cards, income, and expenses — with a clean UI and data-first backend.
- **📊 Investor Risk Profile Tool** – Inspired by Riskalyze, this dynamic 3-step simulation uses React, shadcn/ui, and charts to calculate risk appetite through visual decision scenarios.
- **🔌 Plugin Dev** – Custom WordPress + WooCommerce plugins for member-based access control and API integrations (Hubla, MemberPress, Fluent SMTP).
